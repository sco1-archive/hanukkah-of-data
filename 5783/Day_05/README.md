"Yes, I did have that tapestry for a little bit. I even cleaned a blotchy section that turned out to be a friendly koala.

"But it was still really dirty, so when I was going through a Marie Kondo phase, I decided it wasn't sparking joy anymore.

"I listed it on Freecycle, and a woman in Queens Village came to pick it up. She was wearing a 'Noah's Market' sweatshirt, and it was just covered in cat hair. When I suggested that a clowder of cats might ruin such a fine tapestry, she looked at me funny and said she only had ten or eleven cats and they were getting quite old and had cataracts now so they probably wouldn't notice some old rug anyway.

"It took her 20 minutes to stuff the tapestry into some plastic bags she brought because it was raining. I spent the evening cleaning my apartment."

What's the phone number of the woman from Freecycle?
