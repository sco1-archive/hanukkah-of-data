## What is Hanukkah of Data?
[Hanukkah of Data][1] is a set of short data challenges released over 8 days of Hanukkah. The same fictional dataset is used for all puzzles. Explore this dataset with the tools of your choice to figure out the answers and light the Hanukkah candles.

## What is this repository?
This repository contains my attempted solutions for each year's Hanukkah of Data event. Time permitting, solutions will be written in Python and maybe [Lox](https://github.com/sco1/pylox), MATLAB, Rust, or Julia.

In most cases the provided solutions represent a "first-thoughts" approach to the day's problem rather than the most efficient.
